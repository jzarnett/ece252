Compiling the Code Examples

- They are all intended to be compiled under Linux (generally Ubuntu)
- Use gcc, always with -std=c99 (or higher)
- Use the -g flag for debugging symbols if desired
- Use -o outputfilename to change the output filename from the default "a.out"
- Additional libraries are sometimes needed to be linked, such as -pthread 
- Execute by running ./a.out (or whatever other executable name you've chosen)

Example:
gcc -std=c99 -pthread -g -o thread1 thread-example1.c
./thread1
